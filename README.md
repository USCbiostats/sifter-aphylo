# Running sifter on the aphylo trees

This repository contains the code used to make predictions with SIFTER using
the same phylogenetic trees and GO annotations featured in the aphylo paper.

## Downloads

The sifter program was downloaded from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/BrennerLab/SIFTER/tree/8274cac492a1c7355c4d92df548d6997dbb6b4b1).
The entire repository was decompress under `SIFTER-master`.

The data to run SIFTER was downloaded from

- SQL database https://sifter.berkeley.edu/media/sifter_db.gz
- Pfam families https://sifter.berkeley.edu/media/families_data.tar.gz

The Phylogenetic trees and GO annotations used to generate the data
from the aphylo paper can be obtained from here:

- Trees
- GO annotations
