The dataset `data/candidate_trees.rds` was extracted directly from
this repository [USCbiostats/aphylo-simulations](https://github.com/USCbiostats/aphylo-simulations),
and corresponds to the list of trees proteins that were used in the paper
"On the automatic annotation of gene functions using phylogenetic trees".
