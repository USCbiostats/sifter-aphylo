These data include 100 input files to SIFTER for 100 families from
Pfam release 24.0 and the GOA Uniprot database downloaded in March,
2010. These only include experimental evidence.

See the script directory in SIFTER 2.0 for the scripts on how to run
this complete set of proteins in this version of SIFTER (equivalent
scripts can be built for the previous version).

These data are described in detail in the Supplemental material for
Engelhardt et al., 2010. If you choose to use these data, please cite

Thank you.
